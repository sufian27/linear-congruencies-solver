# linear-congruencies-solver

The project uses the chinese remainder theorem to solve a system of three linear congruencies. 
The program will not work until the conditions of the chinese remainder theorem are met i.e. the three numbers entered after mod must be pairwise relatively prime. 
Press the "SOLVE!" button to get the answer displayed at the bottom.
